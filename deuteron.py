# Deuteron code: Calculates observables for deuteron given an NN potential (can
# be SRG evolved). The class contains functions that obtain the deuteron wave
# function in either momentum- or coordinate-space, functions that calculate 
# observable quantities, and functions that return operators in momentum-space.
