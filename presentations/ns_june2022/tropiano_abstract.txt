The quasi-deuteron model introduced by Levinger is a high-resolution renormalization group (RG) framework used to explain cross sections for knocking out high-momentum protons in photo-absorption on nuclei. Assuming a one-body operator, the nuclear wave function must include two-body short-range correlations (SRC) with deuteron-like quantum numbers. In a recent work, we showed that SRC physics is naturally accounted for at low RG resolution. Here we extend the low RG resolution framework to the quasi-deuteron model. The initial one-body reaction operator that dominates at high RG resolution is evolved to low RG resolution to include a universal, induced two-body operator that accounts for the SRC physics. We can then make local-density approximations with uncorrelated wave functions in evaluating nuclear matrix elements, which greatly simplifies the analysis. Previous studies have predicted or extracted the so-called Levinger constant, which is a number proportional to the ratio of nuclear photo-absorption to that for photo-disintegration of a deuteron. Following suit, we calculate the Levinger constant under various schemes at low RG resolution. We give results for a wide range of nuclei comparing to experimental extractions of the Levinger constant. The Levinger constant predictions are in good agreement with experiment when starting with a hard nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction. With soft NN interactions, it is necessary to include an initial two-body operator before evolving to the low RG scale.
