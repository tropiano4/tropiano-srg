Title: Operator evolution from the similarity renormalization group


I. Introduction

  * Make third paragraph of notes into a slide

II. SRG formalism

III. Universality in chiral potentials

  * Train the audience by showing contours first then diagonal elements
  * Make phase shifts point
  * Potential slices with phase shifts

IV. Operator evolution

  * Momentum projection operator for different potentials and generators
  * Use deuteron momentum distribution to help understand
  * Look at slices
  * Integrand of <Psi|a_q^dagger a_q|psi>

V. Conclusion
  * Summary
  * Outlook
    - High cutoffs
    - Other operators: r^2
