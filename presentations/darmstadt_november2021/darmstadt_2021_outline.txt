OUTLINE FOR TU DARMSTADT SEMINAR:

Short-range correlation physics at low RG resolution

* Title slide

1. Motivation CHECK
   * Outline of talk: SRC calculations at low RG resolution and connecting to existing
    phenomenology (GCF/LCA)
   * How are SRC pairs defined? Depends on scale and scheme!
   * High and low RG wave function/momentum distributions
   * High and low RG operators (current)
   * Takeaways
   [Figures: High/low RG resolution momentum distributions, knockout diagrams]

2. SRG (formalism) CHECK
   * Motivation: Use the SRG to change to scale to low RG resolution set by \lambda
   * Mathematical details: Flow equation, unitarity, etc.
   [Figures: AV18 decoupling under two SRG generators]

3. SRG (deuteron wave functions) CHECK
   * Comparison of deuteron wave functions at high- and low-RG resolution
   * Takeaways
   * Figures: AV18/N2LO deuteron wave functions initial and SRG-evolved

4. Transition slide CHECK
  * SRC physics shifted to operator (show matrix element)
  * Look at evolution of \ataq and evaluation of <\psi_d|\ataq|\psi_d>
  [Figures: Contours of \ataq and integrand of <\psi_d|\ataq|\psi_d>]

5. Momentum distributions at low RG resolution (formulas) CHECK
  * Momentum distribution operators (single-nucleon and pair)
  * SRG transformation in second quantization
    - QUESTION: Why isn't there a 1-body term?
  * Expand out the various terms
  * Circle the 2-body high momentum tail component (explain why everything else is small)
  (mostly formulas)

6. Deuteron example CHECK
  * Formulas for the contributions to deuteron (step through)
  * Maybe add more details as in SB talk (Leading order operator product expansion)
  [Figures: Contributions to the deuteron momentum distribution]

7. Factorization CHECK
  * Factorization -> cancellation in ratios -> scaling (A/d ratios)
    - QUESTION: Why does it factorize?
  (mostly formulas)

8. Why low resolution? CHECK
  * Motivation: methods that rely on soft interactions work well!
  * Strategy: How much can we describe with simple approximations?
  * HF treated in LDA for A-body low momentum nuclear matrix element (free Fermi gas)
  (maybe flash back to previous slide with this circled part?)
  [Figures: Nuclear hockey stick]

QUESTION: How do momentum distributions relate to inclusive cross sections in knockout reactions?

9. Proton momentum distributions CHECK
  * Background detail of calculation: using EDFs from SLy4 and HFBRAD code
  * Comparing to calculations by AV18 QMC
  * Takeaways
  [Figures: Single-nucleon momentum distributions compared to AV18]

10. Universality CHECK
  * Flash back formula showing 2-body dependence of tail -> universality
  [Figures: Overlaying single-nucleon momentum distributions on the same plot]

11. SRC scaling factors CHECK
  * Experimental definition of a_2
  * Related to ratio of bound-nucleon probability distributions in the limits of vanishing
    relative distance or equivalently, infinitely high relative momentum
  * The short-distance internucleon behavior in nuclei is characterized by the A=2 universal functions
  * Details of theoretical calculation
    - QUESTION: Why is a2 given by these integrals?
  * Takeaways
  [Figures: A/d cross sections, a_2 plot]

12. SRC phenomenology (pp/pn)
  * Discuss CLAS figure highlighting dominance of pn pairs
    Focus on Figure on the right:
	Shows the pair fraction comparing pn and pp pairs.
	The np pairs dominate at about 400 MeV.
	At high RG resolution, tensor force/repulsive core of the NN interaction kick nucleon pairs into SRC pairs
        The np dominates because the tensor force requires spin triplet pairs whereas pp are spin singlets
	Can we describe this physics at low RG resolution?
    At low RG resolution, SRCs are suppressed in the wave function and shifted into the operator
    U \ataq U = U(k,q)U(q,k').
    Take ratio of 3S1 and 1S0 SRG transformations fixing low momentum scales (k and k'~0.1 fm^-1)
  * Tensor force and pn dominance
  * Discuss low RG resolution picture: shifted into operator
  * Look at ratio of 3S1/1S0!
  * This is reflected in the pair momentum distributions at Q=0
  * Add explanatory equation on pp/pn slide (see SB talk)
  * Takeaway
  [Figures: CLAS figure, 3S1/1S0 figure, pp/pn figure]

13. SRC phenomenology (p/n)
  * Isospin dependence and takeaway
  [Figures: (pp+pn)/(nn+np) ratio]

14. Gade plot
  * Other exclusive knockout reactions
  * Discuss exp/th < 1
  * Crucial for structure and operator to be treated at the same RG resolution scale
  * Use SRG in analyzing spectroscopic factors (transition?)
  [Figures: Gade plot]

15. Spectroscopic factors (could be expanded)
  * Definition at high RG resolution and issue
  * Quenching
  * Low RG resolution idea
