OUTLINE FOR TU DARMSTADT SEMINAR:

Short-range correlation physics at low RG resolution

* Title slide

1. Motivation
   * Outline of talk: SRC calculations at low RG resolution and connecting to existing
    phenomenology (GCF/LCA)
   * How are SRC pairs defined? Depends on scale and scheme!
   * High and low RG wave function or momentum distributions
   * High and low RG operators (current)
   * Takeaways
   [Figures: High/low RG resolution momentum distributions, knockout diagrams]

2. SRG (formalism)
   * Motivation: Use the SRG to change to scale to low RG resolution set by \lambda
   * Mathematical details
   [Figures: AV18 decoupling under two SRG generators]

3. SRG (deuteron)
   * Comparison of deuteron wave functions at high- and low-RG resolution
   * Takeaways
   * Figures: AV18/N2LO deuteron wave functions initial and SRG-evolved

4. Transition slide
  * SRC physics shifted to operator (show matrix element)
  * Look at evolution of \ataq and evaluation of <\psi_d|\ataq|\psi_d>
  [Figures: Contours of \ataq and integrand of <\psi_d|\ataq|\psi_d>]

5. Momentum distributions at low RG resolution (formulas)
  * Momentum distribution operators (single-nucleon and pair)
  * SRG transformation in second quantization
  * Expand out the various terms
  * Circle the 2-body high momentum tail component (explain why everything else is small)
  (mostly formulas -> see SB talk)

6. Deuteron example
  * Formulas for the contributions to deuteron (step through)
  [Figures: Contributions to the deuteron momentum distribution]

7. Factorization
  * Factorization -> cancellation in ratios -> scaling (A/d ratios)
  (mostly formulas -> see SB talk)

8. Momentum distributions at low RG resolution
  * Why low resolution? (Motivation: methods that rely on soft interactions work well!)
  * HF treated in LDA for A-body low momentum nuclear matrix element (free Fermi gas)
  (maybe flash back to previous slide with this circled part?)
  [Figures: Nuclear hockey stick]

9. Proton momentum distributions
  * Background detail of calculation: using EDFs from SLy4 and HFBRAD code
  * Comparing to calculations by AV18 QMC
  * Takeaways
  [Figures: Single-nucleon momentum distributions compared to AV18]

10. Universality
  * Flash back formula showing 2-body dependence of tail -> universality
  [Figures: Overlaying single-nucleon momentum distributions on the same plot]

11. SRC scaling factors
  * Experimental definition of a_2
  * Details of theoretical calculation
  * Takeaways
  [Figures: A/d cross sections, a_2 plot]

12. SRC phenomenology (pp/pn)
  * Discuss CLAS figure highlighting dominance of pn pairs
  * Tensor force and pn dominance
  * Discuss low RG resolution picture: shifted into operator
  * Look at ratio of 3S1/1S0!
  * This is reflected in the pair momentum distributions at Q=0
  * Add explanatory equation on pp/pn slide (see SB talk)
  * Takeaway
  [Figures: CLAS figure, 3S1/1S0 figure, pp/pn figure]

13. SRC phenomenology (p/n)
  * Isospin dependence and takeaway
  [Figures: (pp+pn)/(nn+np) ratio]

14. Gade plot
  * Other exclusive knockout reactions
  * Discuss exp/th < 1
  * Crucial for structure and operator to be treated at the same RG resolution scale
  * Use SRG in analyzing spectroscopic factors (transition?)
  [Figures: Gade plot]

15. Spectroscopic factors
  * Definition at high RG resolution and issue
  * Quenching
  * Low RG resolution idea
  [Figures: Spectroscopic factors from DF talk, IPM/LRC/SRC figure from DF talk]

16. Summary and outlook
  * Spectroscopic factors for (e,e'p)
  * SRG with optical potentials (hadronic probes)
  * Uncertainty quantification

* Extras


* Ideas from SB/DF talks *

  - Maybe try expanding your introductory slide out a bit more like SB.
    Two pictures: high and low resolution defined in terms of wave functions/momentum distributions.
    Then the operator comparison.
    Then the takeaway points (same as before).

  - Outline of talk: doing SRC calculations at low RG resolution and connecting to existing
    phenomenology (GCF/LCA)

  - Add more formulas to show how you evaluate momentum distributions (see SB early slides and 11)

  - Add a simple methods work slide (e.g., nuclear hockey stick?)

  - Add explanatory equation on pp/pn slide (see SB talk)

  - Add figure of spectroscopic factors and IPM/LRC/SRC
 
  - Add back in universality slide (high momentum tail scales)

* Possible extra slides *
  - Factorization slide
  - \lambda dependence
  - Bar chart for deuteron?
  - Any takeaway points from paper?
