OUTLINE FOR TU DARMSTADT SEMINAR:

Short-range correlation physics at low RG resolution

* Title slide

1. Motivation
   * Outline of talk: SRC calculations at low RG resolution and connecting to existing
    phenomenology (GCF/LCA)
   * How are SRC pairs defined? Depends on scale and scheme!
   * High and low RG wave function/momentum distributions
   * High and low RG operators (current)
   * Takeaways
   [Figures: High/low RG resolution momentum distributions, knockout diagrams]

2. SRG (formalism)
   * Motivation: Use the SRG to change to scale to low RG resolution set by \lambda
   * Mathematical details: Flow equation, unitarity, etc.
   [Figures: AV18 decoupling under two SRG generators]

3. SRG (deuteron wave functions)
   * Comparison of deuteron wave functions at high- and low-RG resolution
   * Takeaways
   [Figures: AV18/N2LO deuteron wave functions initial and SRG-evolved]

4. Transition slide
  * SRC physics shifted to operator (show matrix element)
  * Look at evolution of \ataq and evaluation of <\psi_d|\ataq|\psi_d>
  [Figures: Contours of \ataq and integrand of <\psi_d|\ataq|\psi_d>]

5. Momentum distributions at low RG resolution (formulas)
  * Momentum distribution operators (single-nucleon and pair)
  * SRG transformation in second quantization
  * Expand out the various terms
  * Circle the 2-body high momentum tail component
  (mostly formulas)

6. Deuteron example
  * Formulas for the contributions to deuteron (step through)
  * Maybe add more details as in SB talk (Leading order operator product expansion)
  [Figures: Contributions to the deuteron momentum distribution]

7. Factorization
  * Factorization -> cancellation in ratios -> scaling (A/d ratios)
  (mostly formulas)

8. Why low resolution?
  * Motivation: methods that rely on soft interactions work well!
  * Strategy: How much can we describe with simple approximations?
  * HF treated in LDA for A-body low momentum nuclear matrix element (free Fermi gas)
  [Figures: Nuclear hockey stick]

9. Single-nucleon momentum distribution
  * Start with operator sandwiched with | \Psi_A^\lambda >
  * Take continuum limit
  * Evaluate matrix elements assuming HF+LDA (e.g., \delta U term)
    < \Psi_A^\lambda | a^\dagger a^\dagger a a |\Psi_A^\lambda > ~ \int d^3R \delta(k-k') \theta's
    - Occupied up to kF(R) and averaging over kF(R) with integration over R
  * Angle-average to evaluate angular dependence of K_vec \dot k_vec, etc.
  * Write in terms of partial waves: \bra{k1 \sigma1 \tau1 ... > = ...
  * Overlay final formula

10. Proton momentum distributions
  * Background detail of calculation: using EDFs from SLy4 and HFBRAD code
  * Comparing to calculations by AV18 QMC
  * Takeaways
  [Figures: Single-nucleon momentum distributions compared to AV18]

11. Universality
  * Show 2-body dependence of tail (universality)
  [Figures: Overlaying single-nucleon momentum distributions on the same plot]

12. SRC scaling factors
  * Experimental definition of a_2
  * Related to ratio of bound-nucleon probability distributions in the limits of vanishing
    relative distance or equivalently, infinitely high relative momentum
  * The short-distance internucleon behavior in nuclei is characterized by the A=2 universal functions
  * Details of theoretical calculation
  * Takeaways
  [Figures: A/d cross sections, a_2 plot]

13. SRC phenomenology (pp/pn)
  * Discuss CLAS figure highlighting dominance of pn pairs
  * Focus on Figure on the right:
    - Shows the pair fraction comparing pn and pp pairs.
    - The np pairs dominate at about 400 MeV.
    - At high RG resolution, tensor force/repulsive core of the NN interaction kick nucleon pairs into SRC pairs.
    - The np dominates because the tensor force requires spin triplet pairs whereas pp are spin singlets.
    - Can we describe this physics at low RG resolution?
  * Following slide:
    - At low RG resolution, SRCs are suppressed in the wave function and shifted into the operator.
    - Explain U \ataq U = U(k,q)U(q,k').
    - Take ratio of 3S1 and 1S0 SRG transformations fixing low momentum scales (k and k'~0.1 fm^-1).
    - Tensor force and pn dominance is evident.
  * Following slide:
    - Explain figure.
    - Reproduces characteristics of cross section ratios.
    - Add explanatory equation on pp/pn slide.

14. SRC phenomenology (p/n)
  * Isospin dependence and takeaway
  [Figures: (pp+pn)/(nn+np) ratio]

15. Exclusive knockout reactions
  * Explain figure.
  * Discuss exp/th < 1.
  * Crucial for structure and operator to be treated at the same RG resolution scale.
  * Use SRG in analyzing spectroscopic factors (as transition) working on (e,e'p) first.
  [Figures: Gade plot]

  * Definition at high RG resolution.
  * Reduction and first figure.
  * Explain LRC/SRC.
