OUTLINE FOR DNP PRESENTATION:

Short-range correlation physics at low RG resolution

1. Title slide

2. Motivation
  * Background on SRCs
  * High resolution and low RG resolution definitions
  * Same observables, different interpretations
  * Figure: electron scattering at high and low RG resolutions
  * Figure: mean field and SRC tail of momentum distribution

3. Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG)
  * Make sure you say SRG is unitary here
  * Figure: Before/after of \psi_d(r)
  * SRC -> no SRC, D-state probability suppressed
  * Observables preserved

4. Momentum distributions at low RG resolution
  * SRC physics shifted from wave functions to operators
  * SRG transformation in second quantization
  * Figure: Deuteron wave function in momentum space, contributions example
  * High-q dominated by \delta U \delta U^\dagger (which factorizes)
  * Apply this strategy for nuclei using LDA

5. Proton momentum distributions
  * Figure: C12, O16, Ca40 momentum distributions with AV18
  * Cite HFBRAD
  * Comparison to AV18: low RG resolution gets same answer as high RG resolution
  * Universality: High-q tail collapses to universal function
  * Works well for high-q and is systematically improvable

6. SRC scaling factors
  * Details of a_2 calculation
  * Figure: a_2 factors
  * Agreement with experiment and LCA

7. SRC phenomenology
  * Figures: compare CLAS figure on np dominance and pp/pn ratios
  * Tensor force and pn dominance
  * pn dominance established in 2-body system and shifted to operator

8. SRC phenomenology
  * Figure: pp+pn/nn+np explaining N/Z dependence

9. Spectroscopic factors
  * Game plot (explain)
  * R < 1 not understood
  * Mismatch of scale in operator and structure
  * In progress: SRG evolve operator

10. Summary and outlook
  * Takeaway: simple approximation works at low RG resolution
  * Can analyze high energy reactions with low RG resolution structure
  * Ongoing work: scale/scheme dependence of extracted properties, FSIs, physical interpretations, optical potentials

11. Extras
  * Cartoon of SRC
  * SRG background
  * S- and D-state contributions bar chart
  * Factorization
  * \lambda dependence
