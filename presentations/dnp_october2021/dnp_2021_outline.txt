OUTLINE FOR DNP PRESENTATION:

Short-range correlation physics at low RG resolution

1. Title slide

2. Motivation
  * Background on SRCs
  * High resolution and low RG resolution definitions
  * Same observables, different interpretations
  * Figure: electron scattering at high and low RG resolutions
  * Figure: mean field and SRC tail of momentum distribution

3. Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG)
  * Make sure you say SRG is unitary here
  * Figure: Before/after of \psi_d(r)
  * SRC -> no SRC, D-state probability suppressed
  * Observables preserved

4. Momentum distributions at low RG resolution
  * SRC physics shifted from wave functions to operators
  * SRG transformation in second quantization
  * Figure: Deuteron wave function in momentum space, contributions example
  * High-q dominated by \delta U \delta U^\dagger (which factorizes)
  * Apply this strategy for nuclei using LDA

5. LDA results (single-nucleon momentum distributions)
  * Universality: High-q tail collapses to universal function
  * Figure: High-q tail
  * Comparison to AV18: low RG resolution gets same answer as high RG resolution
  * Works well for high-q and is systematically improvable
  * Figure: C12, O16, Ca40 momentum distributions with AV18

6. LDA results (a_2 factors)
  * Details of a_2 calculation
  * Figure: a_2 factors
  * Agreement with experiment and LCA

7. LDA results reproduces phenomenology (np dominance, N/Z dependence)
  --- cut ---
  * Do we describe np dominance with low RG resolution?
  * Figure: CLAS figure on np dominance
  * Ratio of operators (and why this is what we look at)
  * Figure: U(k_0,q) ratio of 3S1/1S0
  --- cut ---
  * Figures: compare CLAS figure on np dominance and pp/pn ratios
  * Figure: pp+pn/nn+np explaining N/Z dependence

* You'll need to summarize these results faster

9. Spectroscopic factors
  * Spectroscopic factor definition
  * Motivation: reduction from SRC and LRC, asymmetry in \Delta S
    Theory assumes factorization of reaction and structure (spectroscopic factor)
    But scale and scheme is not unique
    High RG picture: Need depletion of occupied states in shell model to account for reduction in theory cross section
  * Understand from the low RG resolution picture considering first electron-induced knockout reactions

10. Summary and outlook
  * Takeaway: simple approximation works at low RG resolution
  * Can analyze high energy reactions with low RG resolution structure
  * Ongoing work: scale/scheme dependence of extracted properties, FSIs, physical interpretations, optical potentials

11. Extras
  * SRG background
  * Factorization
