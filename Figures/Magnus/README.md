* Description of each figure:

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Name: "potential_contours__kvnn_number_generator.pdf"<br/>
Generated by: "magnus_figures.ipynb"<br/>
Brief description: Plots SRG- and Magnus-evolved potentials for several lambda values from 2.8 to 1.2 fm^-1 and number of terms in the Magnus omega sum from 2 to 10. The name of the file specifies the kvnn number and SRG generator. This is a 3 x 3 figure of contours.

Brief description: Plots diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of SRG- and Magnus-evolved potentials for several lambda values from 10.0 to 1.2 fm^-1 and number of terms in the Magnus omega sum from 2 to 10. The name of the file specifies the kvnn number and SRG generator. This is a 2 x 4 figure.
