IMSRG Outline


Introduction
  - How far should I back up?
      * Progress in ab initio nuclear theory (nuclear hockey stick)
  - Importance of separation of energy scales in nuclear physics
  - Example of SRG for NN potential
  - Extension to nuclear many-body problem
  - Target ground state and low-lying excitations for A-body nucleus

Formalism
  - Flow equation and SRG generator
  - Normal ordering and Wick's theorem
  - Normal-ordered Hamiltonian
  - IMSRG flow equations (M-scheme)

Applications
  - Nuclear many-body problem
      * Observables
  - The Magnus expansion
  - Multi-reference IMSRG
  - Effective Hamiltonians

Conclusion


Figures to include
