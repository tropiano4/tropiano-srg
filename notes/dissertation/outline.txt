1. Background and SRG
   - Low resolution vs high resolution: Simplifications (IMSRG, ab initio, etc.)
   - Use IMSRG to transition to Magnus expansion
2. The Magnus expansion
   - Intruder states in IMSRG
   - Test problem with spurious, deeply bound states
   - Magnus formalism
   - Results
3. Operator evolution
   - Universality
   - Wave functions (define SRCs here)
   - Other operators (regularization schemes)
   - SRG generators or Block-diagonal SRG evolution
4. Factorization
   - Connection to experiment: extracting/calculating process independent quantities
   - Highlight scale and scheme dependence
   - Numerical tests
5. Momentum distributions
   - Background
   - Low resolution vs high resolution: Simplifications (some history?)
   - Second-quantization formalism
   - Momentum distributions and SRC phenomenologies (results)
   - UQ project here?
6. Spectroscopic factors
   - Background (LRCs too)
   - Formalism
   - Results
7. Summary and outlook
