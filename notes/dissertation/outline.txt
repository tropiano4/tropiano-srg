I. Background and SRG
   1. Generic big picture: nuclear physics
      * Can use SRC paper and DF talk as references for history
      * Use research statement and Long Term Plan as references
   2. Nuclear interactions
      * Soft and hard potentials
      * Sub-section for chiral EFT
   3. Many-body methods
      * History on low and high RG resolution descriptions?
      * Similar to Sushant and DF lecture notes.
   4. The Similarity Renormalization Group
      * 
      * Full details on SRG. List things you need to cover below (in no particular order):
        - Flow equation
        - Decoupling
        - Generator (scheme)
        - s and \lambda and \Lambda_BD (scale)
        - Unitarity
        - Operator evolution
        - IMSRG
        - Induced operators
        ...
   5. Motivate recent progress in ab initio with RG and EFT.
   6. Organization of thesis and "original contributions".

II. The Magnus expansion
   - Intruder states in IMSRG
   - Test problem with spurious, deeply bound states
   - Magnus formalism
   - Results

III. Operator evolution
   - Universality
   - Wave functions (define SRCs here)
   - Other operators (regularization schemes)
   - SRG generators or Block-diagonal SRG evolution

IV. Factorization
   - Connection to experiment: extracting/calculating process independent quantities
   - Highlight scale and scheme dependence
   - Numerical tests

V. Short-range correlations
   - Background
   - Low resolution vs high resolution: Simplifications (some history?)
   - Second-quantization formalism
   - Momentum distributions and SRC phenomenologies (results)
   - UQ project here?

VI. Spectroscopic factors
   - Background (LRCs too)
   - Formalism
   - Results

VII. Summary and outlook
