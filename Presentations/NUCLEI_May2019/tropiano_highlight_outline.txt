Title of abstract: Exploring the Magnus expansion and the similarity renormalization group


* Ideas for highlight slide. Focus on something relevant to the Magnus expansion and operator evolution.


1. Using the Magnus expansion to SRG evolve operators

	- Figure: r^2 integrand (can do log-scale to show difference in initial and evolved)
	or momentum projection operator evolving in \lambda.

	- Objectives: Study SRG evolution of operators utilizing the Magnus expansion.

	- Impact: Difficult to do SRG operator evolution in IMSRG. Magnus implementation 
	provides an avenue for operator evolution by drastically reducing the memory required 	for the numerical calculation. We can calculate observables with consistently evolved 	wave functions and operators using the Magnus.


2. Exploring the Magnus expansion and the similarity renormalization group

	- Figure: V(k,k) and V(k,0) evolving in \lambda for SRG and several truncations in 	Magnus sum.

	-Objectives: Test Magnus expansion on 'difficult' potential with spurious bound 
	state(s). Analogous to IMSRG evolving system with intruder state(s).

	-Impact: Choice in SRG generator is important. Can decouple spurious bound state 
	outside low-energy part. Magnus implementation matches the SRG approach independent 
	of generator implying that we can understand the intruder state problem in IMSRG 	computations using the Magnus expansion.


3. SRG operator evolution

	- Basically the same as 1 but more focus on operator evolution and no mention of the 	Magnus expansion.


* Accomplishments: Put work in progress.
