OUTLINE FOR NUCLEI PRESENTATION:

Analyzing scale and scheme dependence in NN operators with the SRG

1. Motivation

2. SRG formalism

3. Universality of potentials
	* Variety of NN interactions - at low-resolution they are the same thing

4. Evolved wave functions
	* Natural consequence: the low-energy states between drastically different potentials also exhibit universality
    	* Use AV18 and some chiral potentials

5. Connection to experiments, scheme and scale dependence
	* Can tune the scale with SRG transformations making a potential with SRC physics like AV18 much softer like a high-order chiral potential.
	* Can use low-energy structure to calculate high-energy reactions by consistently evolving the reactions part.
        * Mismatch of scales leads to incorrect observable.

6. Where does the short-distance physics go?
	* Use ataq as an example, depending on time can provide further detail.
        * Results on r^2 once we figure out what to show.
        * If there is time, additional results on operator evolution to illustrate general behavior.

7. Conclusion
