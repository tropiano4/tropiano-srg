  * Registered title: "Decoupling of bound states with the Magnus expansion and the IM-SRG".

  * What is covered: The Magnus expansion implementation on NN potentials at high EFT cutoffs. The SRG evolution of these potentials 
has shown sensitivity to choice of generator (relative kinetic energy or Wegner). Here we compare the Magnus implementation to the 
typical SRG approach for these potentials and show that the Magnus expansion converges to the SRG result. With the Wegner SRG generator, 
the Magnus expansion can be used to soften NN potentials without shifting deeply bound states in the low-energy scale, and the SRG flow 
equations can be solved with a crude ODE solver without loss of accuracy in the eigenvalues of the evolved operator.

  * Build off of APS talk including more on the RKE semi-local potentials and outlook on the Magnus expansion with the IM-SRG.

  * Figures:
    Decoupling of hamiltonian in Fock-space (from Nathan's seminar)
    Wendt contour (Lambda = 4 fm^-1)
    Wendt contour (Lambda = 9 fm^-1)
    Diagonal/off-diagonal potential matrix elements for several truncations in Magnus (both Wegner and T_rel)
    Contours of potential matrix elements for k = 2, 4 and SRG (non-local; both Wegner and T_rel)
    Contours of potential matrix elements for k = 2, 4 and SRG (semi-local)
    Phase shifts of Magnus, SRG, non-evolved?

  * Outline:

    1. Title slide
      * Essentially the same as APS talk

    2. IM-SRG
      * What is the problem (motivate need for IM-SRG)?
      * How does the IM-SRG work?
      * Save flow eqn, generator, etc. for SRG slide

    3. The Magnus expansion: Formalism
      * U(s), flow equation for Omega(s), details...

    4. The Magnus expansion: Motivation
      * Can solve for any operator
	E.g. electromagnetic moments, transition matrices
      * Can use first-order Euler method with no loss in accuracy in observables

    5. The Magnus expansion: Test case
      * Intruder states, do SRG for test case (Magnus holds in SRG too)

    6. SRG in free-space
      * In free-space:
          Soften operator by decoupling low- and high-momenta (include figure illustrating this)
      * Formalism
          Evolved Hamiltonian, flow equation, generator eta
      * Important take-away: at low cutoffs (~500 MeV), choice of generator does not matter
      * Nothing like intruder states at 4 fm^-1

    7. Test case: NN potentials with large EFT cutoffs
      * Background: what has been shown with the SRG
	  Wendt contour (Lambda = 9 fm^-1), differences in Wegner and T_rel generators
          More detail on previous SRG results
      * Why is this an interesting test problem for the Magnus expansion?
      * "From EFT perspective deeply bound states are outside range of EFT"
      * "In practice, do they corrupt low momentum physics?"
      * Transition to weird Wegner T_rel behavior in SRG
      * Reference new paper

    8. Results: Convergence of Magnus to SRG
      * Use non-local potential
      * Diagonals and off-diagonals figure(s)
      * Contours for Wegner
      * Contours for T_rel
      * Important take-away: the evolution of the spurious bound state matches SRG behavior REGARDLESS of truncation

    9. Results: Accuracy of observables
      * Repeat U(s) equation (U is unitary)
      * Relative error in deuteron binding energy
      * Include root mean squared error of all eigenvalues?
      * Phase shifts?

    10. Results: Comparison of non- v. semi-local potential
      * Explain distinction of this potential v. the non-local one
      * How does the semi-local potential evolve under the Magnus compared to the SRG?
      * How does the semi-local potential evolve compared to the non-local potential?
      * Same generator sensitivity at low/high cutoffs? UNANSWERED ATM

    11. Summary and outlook
      * Summarize free-space results
      * Outlook
          The Magnus expansion with the IM-SRG
          Where in k does the spurious bound state start appearing?
	  How to compare Lambda_EFT for non- and semi-local?
