The overarching goal of theoretical nuclear physics is to produce a predictive model for nuclei, the core of every atom, to answer open questions such as how the elements are formed or to find the limits of existence for unstable nuclei. The typical starting point of a physics problem is to consider the necessary objects and interactions to make an accurate calculation. In nuclear physics, these "degrees of freedom" vary quite a bit. Some start with the most fundamental constituent particles of nuclei (the reductionist approach) while others consider more composite particles and interactions (the emergent phenomena approach). In my sub-field, I work with proton and neutron degrees of freedom, which can be referred to as low-energy nuclear physics. Protons and neutrons are the positively and neutrally charged composite particles that make up nuclei. We seek to build an effective theory that can make accurate predictions using proton and neutron degrees of freedom. This is complicated: we must use this theory to solve the nuclear many-body problem of many protons and neutrons interacting via the nuclear force. My presentation topic, the Magnus expansion and in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), covers a method used for this task. The IMSRG method is analogous to using a low-resolution image or video for computational efficiency. The IMSRG "lowers the resolution" of the nuclear many-body problem to make calculations feasible.
