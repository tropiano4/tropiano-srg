OUTLINE FOR APS APRIL PRESENTATION:

Short-range correlation physics at low RG resolution

1. Title slide

2. Motivation
  * Recent experiments have been able to isolate processes where short-range correlation (SRC) physics is dominant and well accounted for by SRC phenomenology.
  * Description of high resolution picture
    - SRC pairs are components in the nuclear wave function with relative momenta above the Fermi momentum.
    - FIG: Cartoon of SRC pairs in nucleus and high-k tail.
  * Description of low RG resolution picture
    - Using RG methods we can tune the scale to lower resolution (we refer to this as low RG resolution).
    - SRC physics shifted into the reaction operators from the nuclear wave function.
    - FIG: Cartoon of mean field nucleons and no high-k tail.
  * FIG: Cartoon of high and low-resolution electron scattering.
  * Punch line: same cross section but different interpretations.

3. SRG formalism
  * Unitarily evolve to low RG resolution keeping the same observables.
  * SRG formalism.
  * FIG: AV18 decoupling.
  * FIG: AV deuteron wave function in coordinate space.

4. Computing momentum distributions at low RG resolution

Where does the short distance physics go?
  -Short distance physics (or high momentum physics) shifts to the operator.
  -We can see that by applying the SRG transformation to the momentum distribution operator.
  -Skipping the details point to final high-q term.
Expand SRG transformation. For high-q operator (high-q momentum distribution tails), we isolate the \delta U \delta U^\dagger term.
Factorization of \delta Uâ€™s gives high-q function and low-q A-body matrix element.
Deuteron example. Step through each piece (see SB talk)
Evaluate A-body matrix elements using LDA.

Write this in notebook first.

  * Very brief second quantized equations of U(k,k'), n(q), etc.
  * Highlight factorization.
  * FIG: Deuteron wave function contributions (step through).
  * Evaluate A-body matrix elements under LDA (free Fermi gas).

5. LDA results
  * FIG: high-q tail of momentum distributions. Universality.
    - Scale up the 12C, 16O, 40Ca SNMD's by a factor based on 16O AV18 data.
  * FIG: (pp+pn)/(nn+np) ratio.
    - np dominance to scalar counting.
  * FIG: 3S1-3D1 / 1S0 ratio.
  * FIG: pp/np ratio.
    - np dominance and weak A dependence from factorization.
  * FIG: a2 factors.
    - Equation and decent agreement with LCA calculations.

6. Summary and outlook
  * Summary.
  * Move onto cross sections, scale/scheme dependence of extracted properties.
  * Impact of FSI's, how physical interpretations depend on the RG scale.
  * Knock-out reactions (high resolution operators with low resolution structure mixes scales).
  * What if the probe is a nucleon? See MH talk!

7. Extras
  * Factorization figures.
  * Extra equations on our formalism.


CHANGES TO MAKE STILL

-Think about pn dominance slide and edit
-Take out plot AV18 title where necessary
-Add figure captions
-Cite a_2 data, AV18?, ..., LCA
-Split slides by bullet (e.g., summary/outlook slide)
