OUTLINE FOR DNP PRESENTATION:

Short-range correlation physics from operator evolution

* Motivation

* SRG formalism

* AV18 example with deuteron wave function and potential matrix elements

* Connection to experiments, scheme and scale dependence
	* Alternative picture: tune the scale with SRG transformations making a potential with SRC physics like AV18 much softer
	* Can use low-energy structure to calculate high-energy reactions by consistently evolving the reactions part
        * Example: electron scattering at high and low resolution (Breit frame picture or one-body current with SRC pair vs two-body current diagram?)
        * Mismatch of scales leads to incorrect observable

* Visual demonstration of short distance physics in operator
	* Short distance physics appears in \ataq (can show a few different things here)

* Factorization of SRG transformation (set up for major result)
        * Do you want a picture to show this? Is it necessary?

* Dominance of pn pairs over pp pairs can be understood from looking at these evolved operators
        * Show ratio of U(k_0, q)^2 (3S1 / 1S0) for AV18, maybe N2LO
        * Point out all the features of this picture: 1S0 node, scalar limit, etc.
        * Compare intuition between low and high resolution

7. Conclusion
        * Try calculating pair distribution in nuclei
