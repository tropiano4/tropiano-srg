OUTLINE FOR DNP PRESENTATION:

Short-range correlation physics from operator evolution

1. Title slide

2. Motivation 
  * Recent experiments have been able to isolate processes where short-range correlation (SRC) physics
    is dominant and well accounted for by SRC phenomenology.
  * Description of high-resolution SRC physics: SRC pairs are components in the nuclear wave function with relative momenta above the Fermi momentum.
  * Alternative viewpoint: Using RG methods we can tune the scale to lower resolution (we refer to this as low RG resolution)
    The SRC physics is shifted into the reaction operators from the nuclear wave function.
  * Would be good to mention that RG evolution of hard potential *does not* make the reaction operator hard.
  * Emphasis that experiments use low resolution structure. (mismatch of high and low resolution)
  FIGURES: Cartoon of high and low-resolution electron scattering.

3. SRG formalism
  * Unitarily evolve to low RG resolution keeping the same observables.
  * SRG formalism.
  FIGURES: None.

4. AV18 example with deuteron wave function and potential matrix elements
  * Do band- and block-diagonal decoupling for AV18 in 3S1-3S1.
  * Show a few examples of deuteron wave function in coordinate space.
  FIGURES: Band- and block-diagonal decoupled AV18 in 3S1-3S1, initial and evolved deuteron wave functions.

5. Connection to experiments, scheme and scale dependence
  * Same first bullet as before.
  * Matrix element with unitary transformation.
  * AV18 -> soft potential like chiral potentials.
  * By evolving the operator, we can do high-energy reactions at low RG resolution.
  * Mismatch of scales leads to incorrect observable
  FIGURES: Cartoons to help people understand?

6. Example: momentum distribution of the deuteron wave function
  * Short distance physics appears in the momentum projection operator \ataq
  * Describe evolution of the operator.
  * Note the operator does not get hard!
  * Show the "where does the short-distance physics go?" slide from NUCLEI 2020.
  * Do the expectation value of <\psi_d|\ataq|\psi_d> evolving. Matrix element is the same but the calculation is done at low momentum now!
  * Use table from SRC notes and overlay on slide circling the numbers you're referencing.
  FIGURES: Evolving \ataq, momentum distribution of deuteron, evolving integrand of <\psi_d|\ataq|\psi_d>

7. Factorization of SRG transformation (set up for major result) (can use for back up if it's too much)
  * Show ratio of U(k_i, q) / U(k_0, q) -> U(k, q) ~ K_hi(q) K_lo(k) for k < \lambda << q
  * Can understand the momentum distribution by utilizing factorization of the unitary transformations, which reduces the inner part of the matrix element to a simple form.
  FIGURES: Ratio of U(k_i, q) / U(k_0, q)

8. Dominance of pn pairs over pp pairs in the tensor region
  * Show figure of pn/p vs pp/p pointing out key features.
  * Now show ratio of U(k_0, q)^2 (3S1 / 1S0) for AV18, maybe N2LO.
  * Point out all the features of this picture that are reproduced: 1S0 node, scalar limit, etc.
  * Compare intuition between low and high resolution.
  FIGURES: Figure of pn/p and pp/p ratios, ratio of U(k_0,q)^2_3S1 / U(k_0,q)^2_1S0 (AV18 and Gezerlis only)

9. Conclusion
  * Summary
  * Calculating pair distributions in nuclei (N=Z, N>Z) using LDA.
  * Apply this to knock-out reactions for which SRC physics is not cleanly isolated.
  * Can add cartoons for other processes at low and high resolution.
