OUTLINE FOR NUCLEI PRESENTATION:

Short-range correlation physics at low RG resolution

1. Title slide

2. Motivation
  * Background on SRCs
  * High resolution and low RG resolution definitions
  * Same observables, different interpretations
  * Figure: electron scattering at high and low RG resolutions
  * Figure: mean field and SRC tail of momentum distribution

3. Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG)
  * Equations, unitarity, flow parameter
  * Figure: Band-diagonal decoupling of AV18 potential
  * Note: Maybe these two slides are unnecessary to save time?

4. Deuteron wave function at low RG resolution
  * Figure: Before/after of \psi_d(r)
  * SRC -> no SRC, D-state probability suppressed
  * Observables preserved

5. Momentum distributions at low RG resolution
  * SRC physics shifted from wave functions to operators
  * SRG transformation in second quantization
  * Figure: Deuteron wave function in momentum space, contributions example
  * High-q dominated by \delta U \delta U^\dagger (which factorizes)
  * Apply this strategy for nuclei using LDA

6. LDA results (single-nucleon momentum distributions)
  * Universality: High-q tail collapses to universal function
  * Figure: High-q tail
  * Comparison to AV18: low RG resolution gets same answer as high RG resolution
  * Works well for high-q and is systematically improvable
  * Figure: C12, O16, Ca40 momentum distributions with AV18

7. LDA results (np dominance)
  * Do we describe np dominance with low RG resolution?
  * Figure: CLAS figure on np dominance
  * Ratio of operators (and why this is what we look at)
  * Figure: U(k_0,q) ratio of 3S1/1S0
  * Figure: pp/pn ratios

8. LDA results (N/Z dependence)
  * Figure: pp+pn/nn+np
  * Explain N/Z dependence

9. LDA results (a_2 factors)
  * Details of a_2 calculation
  * Figure: a_2 factors
  * Agreement with experiment and LCA

10. Summary and outlook
  * Takeaway: simple approximation works at low RG resolution
  * Can analyze high energy reactions with low RG resolution structure
  * Ongoing work: scale/scheme dependence of extracted properties, FSIs, physical interpretations, optical potentials
