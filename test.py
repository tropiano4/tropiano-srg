# The purpose of this script is to test out codes. Generally, something is
# tested here, which evolves into several tests/checks. In the case of an
# extensive script, one should save the script as a seperate file with an
# extension _testv#.py where v# corresponds to the version number. For example,
# momentum_projection_operator_testv1.py. Use the revision history below to
# document when and why these files are created.
#
# Revision history:
#   08/30/19 --- Testing how to use *args in Python functions. This may be
#                useful for plotting codes. Created
#                momentum_projection_operator_testv1.py in Old_codes based off
#                last tests in this script.
#   10/01/19 --- Testing SRG-evolution of an operator which is a constant at
#                all values of k and k' (this is a delta function in
#                coordinate-space). Created toy_operator_srg_evolution_v1.py in
#                Old_codes.
#   10/14/19 --- Making a couple of plots for DNP 2019 meeting.
#   03/16/20 --- Tested generalized NN operator conventions and mesh-
#                dependence. Created operators_test.py in Old_codes.
#   04/08/20 --- Tested SRG changes in r^2 operator.
#   05/22/20 --- Testing mesh-dependence in several operators. Created
#                mesh_dependence_test.py in Old_codes.

# Description of this test:
#   Test the approximation K(p) ~ \int_0_\LambdaBD[p'^2 U(p,p')].
