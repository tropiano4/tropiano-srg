--- Research tasks ---

SRC physics
 * Study 2nd quantization
   -Look at contributions to \ataq for l=0, 1, 2, â€¦
   -LDA calculation
   -Run through SRC notes and edit: add notes to figures
 * Read about eikonal approximation
 * Read about Glauber approximation
	
SRG
 * Open questions
   -High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution
 * SRG solver options
   -ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead

Misc.
 * Phase shift corrector function
 * Implement Gez. local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos
