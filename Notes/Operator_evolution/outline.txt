Outline


I. Introduction
  a) Wide range of NN potentials - how do they change under SRG transformations?
  b) Motivate long list of unaddressed questions: regulator, generator dependence, universality, high cutoffs, the Magnus expansion
  c) SRG formalism


II. SRG evolution of NN potentials
  a) Comparison of potential evolution with different regulators, orders, generator
    - N2LO, N3LO, ...; non-local, semi-local, local; Wegner, T_rel, block-diagonal
  b) Universality
  c) Discussion of high cutoffs, block-diagonal generator at high cutoffs and how it handles spurious bound states
  d) Use high cutoffs to transition to Magnus test problem


III. The Magnus expansion
  a) Summary of Wendt high cutoff results and connection to IMSRG intruder state
  b) Formalism
    - Motivation: simplifies computational problem for evolving multiple operators, exact unitarity
    - Important equations and how to evolve operators with omega
  c) Results (comparison to Wendt problem)
    - Implications for IMSRG
  d) Use discussion of operator evolution to transition to next section


IV. Evolution of other operators
  a) SRG operator evolution for different potentials and generators


V. Conclusion
