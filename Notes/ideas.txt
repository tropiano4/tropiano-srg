Ideas for Magnus / SRG operator evolution paper


Primary topics

i) Testing the Magnus expansion for high cutoff potentials using the potentials from Wendt 2011 for comparison

	-Spurious bound states and connection to intruder states in IMSRG calculations

ii) High cutoffs for different potentials (semi-local and non-local) and SRG evolution

	-Universality

iii) Block-diagonal generator for some of the cases above

	-How the block-diagonal generator handles spurious bound states

iv) Operator evolution
