Outline


I. Introduction
  - Wide range of NN potentials
  - SRG formalism

II. SRG evolution of NN potentials
  a) Comparison of potential evolution with different regulators, orders, generator
    - N2LO, N3LO, ...; non-local, semi-local, local; Wegner, T_rel, block-diagonal
  b) Universality
  - Discussion of high cutoffs, block-diagonal generator at high cutoffs
  - Use high cutoffs to transition to Magnus test problem

III. The Magnus expansion
  a) Formalism
    - Put motivation here
  b) Results (comparison to Wendt problem)
    - Implications for IMSRG
  - Discussion of operator evolution

IV. Evolution of other operators
  - SRG operator evolution for different potentials and generators

V. Conclusion
