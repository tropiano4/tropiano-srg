Ideas for Magnus / SRG operator evolution paper


i) Testing the Magnus expansion for high cutoff potentials using the potentials from Wendt 2011 for comparison

	-Spurious bound states and connection to intruder states in IMSRG calculations

ii) SRG/Magnus evolution in different potentials (non-local, local, semi-local)

	-Universality
	-High cutoffs?

iii) Block-diagonal generator for high cutoff potentials and operator evolution

	-How the block-diagonal generator handles spurious bound states

iv) Operator evolution

	-SRG operator evolution for different potentials and generators
