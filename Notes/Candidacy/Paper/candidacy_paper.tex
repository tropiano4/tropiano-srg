%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


Things to include:
\\
-- r-process for motivation.
\\
-- Include multiple scattering, self-consistent Green's function methods.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Phenomenology of optical potentials}
\label{sec:section_2}


Things to include:
\\
-- Form of the potential: Woods-Saxon shape, coulomb component, spin-orbit force.
\\
-- Fit strength, radii, and diffuseness of complex potential.
\\
-- Issue: fitting ambiguities, extractions to exotic regions of the nuclear chart.
\\
-- Make sure to touch on phenomenology of optical potentials in modern experimental analyses (key word is modern!)



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Ab initio optical potentials}
\label{sec:section_3}


Things to include:
\\
-- Successes and limitations.
\\
-- Motivation: predictions for exotic region of the nuclear chart.
\\
-- Coupled cluster Green's function \cite{Rotureau:2016jpf}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Theoretical issues}
\label{sec:section_4}


Things to include:
\\
-- Fitting ambiguities for phenomenological potential.
\\
-- Uncertainty quantification.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


Summary and outlook.
