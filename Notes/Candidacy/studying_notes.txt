Studying notes for candidacy


* Derivation of the LS equation
    - Assume the Hamiltonian is split into free and interacting part
    - Free part has eigenvalues E with waves phi, full Hamiltonian has eigenvalues E with wave function psi
    - Re-order psi eigenvalue/eigenvector equation for psi assuming psi -> phi as V -> 0 and include +/- epsilon to prevent singularity
    - Insert complete set of states for phi
    - Label quantum number alpha for full Hamiltonian, T-matrix

* The S-matrix
    - Just remember that S_{fi} = < Phi_f | Psi(t) > where Psi(t) is the state evolved from the free state.
    - Or S_{fi} = < Phi_f | S | Phi_i > where S = U(inf, -inf) the time evolution operator
    - Relation to observables...

* Why is the nuclear scattering problem the relevant problem to solve?

* Nuclear resonances: how they show up in quantum scattering.

* How does the difficulty of a nuclear many-body calculation scale with A? Exponential? Power law?

* Understand optics analogy

--- FORMALISM ---

* What is in V in (2) that is not in H_A?

* After (6) you say other indices describe an emergent nucleon. Does there have to be a nucleon emerging? As opposed to being absorbed?

* What is the S-matrix? Relation to observables

* Why does going from (14b) to (15) pick up i\eta? Are there other choices?

* Epsilon_0 = 0 business

* Be able to sketch a derivation of 17-18

--- PHENOMENOLOGY ---

* Can you derive (20)? Is this quantum mechanical?

* How is this related to nuclear density?

* Understand spin-orbit, volume, surface part of potential physically

* What is a diffusivity parameter?

* Where does the pion mass come in?

* Derive the Coulomb potential for a uniformly spherical charged distribution

* Read Koning (page 243) on energy dependence of OMP’s

--- MULTIPLE-SCATTERING ---

* What is the T-matrix? How does it relate to the Schrodinger equation?

* Time-ordered Green's functions

* Why is it called the "spectator expansion"? What is the expansion parameter?

* How good of an approximation is the impulse approximation?

* Corrections to the impulse approximation

* Calculating the Møller factor

* How does this relate to the phenomenological forms?

* Have an idea about the NCSM.

* Why does one divide by the Rutherford cross section in figure 4?

* Derive Rutherford cross-section (or at least be able to say what it is)

* Why are 3NF important and hard to implement here?

--- SELF-ENERGY ---

* What is chiral symmetry breaking?

* Chiral perturbation theory (notes on Epelbaum 2010)

* Why is a cutoff necessary?

* How is it possible (or why is it valid) to use a contact term to describe short-range physics? What does a cutoff do to a contact term?

* Self-energy from many-body physics textbook

* Explain how equations 31-33 connect to diagrams. DF comment below:
	- Looking at Figure 5, you state the characteristics of the contributions resulting from each of the diagrams.  How do I see them? 
	- For (a), the diagram looks local (with a local potential). Why is it actually non-local? (Hint: the figure actually only shows the Hartree term unless you say that the wavy lines are the *antisymmetrized* NN interactions.
	- How can I see that (b) and (c) have imaginary parts? (This may be evident from (32) and (33), but how do I see that from the diagrams?) 
	- If I think of time running upwards, how would you describe the processes depicted in the figures?

* What does it mean to calculate energies self-consistently?

* Explain connection of self-energy to original presentation of optical potential.

* How can you understand diagrammatically how a three-body force becomes a density-dependent two-body force?

--- CONCLUSION ---

* What does uncertainty quantification mean? How do you do it?
