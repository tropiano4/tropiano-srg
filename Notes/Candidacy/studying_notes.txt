Studying notes for candidacy


* Derivation of the LS equation
    - Assume the Hamiltonian is split into free and interacting part
    - Free part has eigenvalues E with waves phi, full Hamiltonian has eigenvalues E with wave function psi
    - Re-order psi eigenvalue/eigenvector equation for psi assuming psi -> phi as V -> 0 and include +/- epsilon to prevent singularity
    - Insert complete set of states for phi
    - Label quantum number alpha for full Hamiltonian, T-matrix

* The S-matrix
    - Just remember that S_{fi} = < Phi_f | Psi(t) > where Psi(t) is the state evolved from the free state.
    - Or S_{fi} = < Phi_f | S | Phi_i > where S = U(inf, -inf) the time evolution operator
    - Relation to observables...

	- Looking at Figure 5, you state the characteristics of the contributions resulting from each of the diagrams.  How do I see them? 
	- For (a), the diagram looks local (with a local potential). Why is it actually non-local? (Hint: the figure actually only shows the Hartree term unless you say that the wavy lines are the *antisymmetrized* NN interactions.
	- How can I see that (b) and (c) have imaginary parts? (This may be evident from (32) and (33), but how do I see that from the diagrams?)
