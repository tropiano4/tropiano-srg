* Derivation of continuity equation
    - Start with SE and its complex conjugate
    - Define probability density rho and its current
    - Multiply by psi* and psi respectively
    - Substitute these equations in probability current
    - Sort terms to define current j

* Derivation of the LS equation
    - Assume the Hamiltonian is split into free and interacting part
    - Free part has eigenvalues E with waves phi, full Hamiltonian has eigenvalues E with wave function psi
    - Re-order psi eigenvalue/eigenvector equation for psi assuming psi -> phi as V -> 0 and include +/- epsilon to prevent singularity
    - Insert complete set of states for phi
    - Label quantum number alpha for full Hamiltonian, T-matrix

* The S-matrix
    - Just remember that S_{fi} = < Phi_f | Psi(t) > where Psi(t) is the state evolved from the free state.
    - Or S_{fi} = < Phi_f | S | Phi_i > where S = U(inf, -inf) the time evolution operator
    - Relation to observables...
