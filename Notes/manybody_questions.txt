--- Questions on many-body physics ---

* Why are there different pictures in quantum mechanics? Is this really just a different way to solve for the time-dependence in the Schrodinger equation?
* Why are wave functions present in the definition of the field operators \psi (2.1) and (3.1)? How is this connected to building up Lagrangians defined by fields not variables like position, momentum, etc.?
  ANSWER: Different wave to write operators concisely (mathematically equivalent) and we
  can think of the connection to QFT because the operator now depends on a continuous
  variable.
* Chapter on Green's functions in Fetter and Walecka.
