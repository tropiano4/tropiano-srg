# LENT

This repository is for research done during my (Anthony Tropiano) PhD at OSU.

Description of each folder:

* Papers contains all papers relevant to research (i.e. SRG papers, chiral EFT papers, etc.)

* Notes contains pdf notes relevant to some of the tools used in these codes. Add anything that does not qualify as a paper or presentation to this folder. Also contains sub-folders of LaTeX notes (e.g. the draft of our Magnus paper).

* Potentials/vsrg_macos contains all Fortran and Perl codes used to create chiral NN potentials. Also stores the initial and evolved potentials and momentum arrays. See the README in this sub-directory for more information on how to generate potentials.

* Presentations contains all the files used for presentations like the annual DNP or NUCLEI meetings.
