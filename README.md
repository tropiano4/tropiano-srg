__Nuclear physics at low renormalization group resolution__
===========================================================

This repository contains codes and files relevant to similarity renormalization group (SRG) work done by Anthony Tropiano and collaborators.
Jupyter notebooks in __code__ generate figures of SRG evolution and applications to short-range correlation physics, the quasi-deuteron model, and more, where the figure files are stored in __figures__.
See the references listed in the Jupyter notebooks for details.
The notebooks rely on scripts stored in __code/scripts__ and data files in __data__.

__Dependencies__
================

This repository is compatible with Python 3, but has not been tested with Python 2.
It relies heavily on functions from Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy, all of which are included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.
Many of the data files in __data__ are generated by codes external to this repository (e.g., densities in __dft/SLy4__ are generated by the `HFBRAD` Fortran code).
