This repository contains codes and files relevant to SRG work done by AJT and collaborators.
Jupyter notebooks in __code__ generate figures of SRG evolution and applications to short-range correlation physics, the quasi-deuteron model, and more, where the figure files are stored in __figures__. 
Notebooks rely on scripts stored in __code/scripts__ and files in __data__.

__Dependencies__
================

This repository is compatible with Python 3, but has not been tested with Python 2.
It relies heavily on functions from Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy, all of which are included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.
Many of potential matrix elements files in data are generated by Fortran codes external to this repository.
