--- Numerical/analytical work ---

* Try doing derivation but changing \delta U^\dagger creation/annihiliation operators
  to s.p. states instead
* Add other nuclear s.p. wave functions to densities

  ...

* HF ground state with s.p. wave functions (SNMD calculation)
* How to do correlated ground state (references?)
* 3-D \lambda dependence plot (with q)
* How can 3-body terms be approximated (Bogner_2007qb)
* Approximations for electrodisintegration? Inclusion of FSIs?
* Fix Potentials Fortran and Perl codes (not finding BLAS)
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos
* Test C++ with SRG flow equation
* Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
* SRG inherit Potentials class? Generators inherit SRG class? (See FRIBTA scattering notebooks for examples)
* Implementing Loguru, snoop, and heart rate

Note: This also includes presentation-related work
