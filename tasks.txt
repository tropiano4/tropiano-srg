--- Numerical/analytical work ---

* Understand spin projection dependence in overlap
  - \delta U^\dagger term
  - Update iPad notes
* What is the justification for \kF = \kF(R=0) approximation?
* Add other nuclear s.p. wave functions to densities

  ...

* HF ground state with s.p. wave functions (SNMD calculation)
* How to do correlated ground state (references?)
* 3-D \lambda dependence plot (with q)
* How can 3-body terms be approximated (Bogner_2007qb)
* Approximations for electrodisintegration? Inclusion of FSIs?
* SRG with EC and emulators
* Fix Potentials Fortran and Perl codes (not finding BLAS)
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos
* Test C++ with SRG flow equation
* Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
* SRG inherit Potentials class? Generators inherit SRG class? (See FRIBTA scattering notebooks for examples)
* Implementing Loguru, snoop, and heart rate

Note: This should also include presentation-related work


--- Overleaf ---

* Implement outline/game plan from iPad to Overleaf (sf_paper.tex)
* Convert low_res_knockout.tex to sf_notes.tex (sf_notes.tex)
* Add seminar questions to Overleaf with first pass of answers (sf_notes.tex)
* Derivation of Dec 15th equation in notebook (sf_notes.tex)
* Add results corresponding to Dec 15th derivation
* Read optical potential notes and add comments
