--- SRC ---

* Knock-out reactions
  - Approximations for electrodisintegration (see SM papers / questions)
  - Read electron scattering references (questions)
    * Ulmer ODU presentation [nuclear structure section and up]
    * Frois_1987hk
    * Start Overleaf notes on basics: general picture, spectral functions, spectroscopic factors
      - Outline first
    * Marshall_2020ahl
  - SRG evolve spectroscopic factor U a U^\dagger (how do we calculate B p?)

* Extensions to SRC physics at low RG resolution
  - 3-D version of \lambda dependence plot
  - 2nd term in DME
    * Check Heaviside function from the d^3s integral in the single-nucleon case
    * Check the second term by including it in a simple calculation involving only the
      normalization of the density matrix.
  - Check each diagram and think of others. Add takeaway points to Overleaf.
  - How can you approximate 3-body terms? Read Bogner_2007qb.

* Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)
  - Read Weiss_2016obx for reference
  - Inconsistency on how to extract? You can use single-nucleon probability distribution if you
    isolate the following pieces: 1S0/nn, 1S0/pp, 1S0/pn, 3S1/pn
    Or alternatively, integrate 1/N \int_kF^\infty d3q / (2\pi)^3 \int d3Q / (2\pi)^3 n(q, Q)
    where N is the total normalization of the pair momentum distribution (they use N = A/2)
