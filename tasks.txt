--- SRC ---

 * iPad notes on U U^\dagger check

 * Updates to SRC paper
   - Update description of Fig. 4 (based on your comment)
   - Describe n(q)/Z figure in text
   - Describe a_2 figure in text giving simple equation
   - Add U(k, q_i)^2 / U(k, q_0)^2 figure to supplementary files
   - Update description of second-quantized equations

 * Update SRC notes with new figures

 * Updates to momentum distributions file
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Focus on practicality and how you can make this clear to others
     (the goal is to figure out where mistakes are being made!)
   - Attach codes and figures
   - Add normalizations
   - Correct iPad notes?

 * Finalize extra functions in SRC notebooks
   - A/C12 ratio
   - GCF contacts: ratios and absolute
   - Factorization in other partial waves (e.g., U_1P1(k_i, q) / U_1P1(k_0, q)
   - Numerically check asymptotic relation of SNMD and PMD

 * Add 'Integrate' option to pmd.py

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?
