 * Derive pair momentum distribution before partial waving then check asymptotic relation

 * Cancellation of \delta U terms: try interpolating n(q, kF) first for each q in q_array and kF in q_array up to ~1.5 fm^-1
 
 * Correct first term in pair \int d3r d3r'
 
 * Compare pair to C12 AV18

 * Add derivations to Overleaf

 * Compare \delta U and \delta U^2 cancellation for deuteron exact vs LDA
   - Go through expansion of momentum distribution operators for single-nucleon and pair
   - Evaluate with respect to |F> and |\psi_d>
   - Checks: 
     1. SNMD vs PMD with |\psi_d>
     2. Cancellation of \delta U + \delta U^\dagger + \int \delta U^2 for |\psi_d>
     3. |F> vs |\psi_d> with SNMD (or PMD whatever is easier to see)

 * Updates to momentum distributions file
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Focus on practicality and how you can make this clear to others
     (the goal is to figure out where mistakes are being made!)
   - Attach codes and figures
   - Correct iPad notes?

 * Update snmd.py to account for q \dot K angle
   - Update to have one double \theta function evaluation for pn
   - Create table of n_N(q, kF_1, kF_2) and make an interpolating function using RegularGridInterpolator

 * Check that angle-averaging gives the same result as analytic for N=Z

 * Update SRC notes with new figures

 * Finalize extra functions in SRC notebooks
   - A/C12 ratio
   - GCF contacts: ratios and absolute
   - Factorization in other partial waves (e.g., U_1P1(k_i, q) / U_1P1(k_0, q)
   - Numerically check asymptotic relation of SNMD and PMD

 * Add 'Integrate' option to pmd.py

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?
