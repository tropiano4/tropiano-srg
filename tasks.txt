--- SRC ---

* Extensions to SRC physics at low RG resolution
   - Change \beta to 1/\beta
   - 2nd term in DME (questions)
   - Check each diagram and think of others. Add takeaway points to Overleaf.
   - Think again why \lambda dependence is important. Read Neff again. (Summarize in your own words.)
   - How can you approximate 3-body terms? Read Bogner_2007qb.
   - Update notes after reading papers. Add Negele summary or something about DME?

 * Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)
   - Read Weiss_2016obx for reference
   - Inconsistency on how to extract? You can use single-nucleon probability distribution if you
     isolate the following pieces: 1S0/nn, 1S0/pp, 1S0/pn, 3S1/pn
     Or alternatively, integrate 1/N \int_kF^\infty d3q / (2\pi)^3 \int d3Q / (2\pi)^3 n(q, Q)
     where N is the total normalization of the pair momentum distribution (they use N = A/2)

 * Approximations for electrodisintegration

 * Read QE electron scattering references

  Summary
  - Harmonic oscillator basis for A = 4 (He4)
  - SRG does not reshuffle hierarchy of many-body terms in \chi^EFT
  - \lambda = 2 fm^-1 is a good compromise between improved convergence from decoupling and
    the growth of induced many-body interactions
  - 2-body evolved operator gets no contribution from 3-body
    3-body evolved operator gets contributions from 2-body but not 4-body
  - Jacobi coordinate harmonic oscillator basis of NCSM
  - NN-only fails and has \lambda dependence, NN+NNN induced is flat but off,
    NN+NNN initial looks good
  - Basis size convergence improved with SRG
  - Net induced four-body contribution is smaller than truncation errors of the chiral interaction
* Negele_1972zp
  Summary
  - Expansion of nuclear wave function density matrix in relative and CM coordinates
  - First term gives local density dependence

--- Momentum distributions ---
* Try profiler on snmd.py to figure out where its slowest
* q = 0 case in pmd.py

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?
