--- SRC ---

* Knock-out reactions
  - Literature review
    * 2021 Schiffer (is it scale and scheme dependent)
  - Add summaries to Overleaf
  - Compute with spectroscopic_factors.ipynb
    * Recap. SNMD case for \sigma and \tau pieces
    * What are labels for a_p? Is it a_{p, \sigma, \tau} or \Sigma_\sigma a_{p, \sigma, \tau}?
    * How do the two cases change the answer? (Factor of 1/2?)
  - Add full derivation to Overleaf
  - Read Barbieri paper
  - How to do correlated ground state (references?)
  - Read references Yang, More
    * Add summary/takeaways to Overleaf notes (questions!)
  - Approximations for electrodisintegration?
  - Inclusion of FSIs

* Extensions to SRC physics at low RG resolution
  - 3-D version of \lambda dependence plot
  - 2nd term in DME
    * Check Heaviside function from the d^3s integral in the single-nucleon case
    * Check the second term by including it in a simple calculation involving only the
      normalization of the density matrix.
  - Check each diagram and think of others. Add takeaway points to Overleaf.
  - How can you approximate 3-body terms? Read Bogner_2007qb.

* Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)
  - Read Weiss_2016obx for reference
  - Inconsistency on how to extract? You can use single-nucleon probability distribution if you
    isolate the following pieces: 1S0/nn, 1S0/pp, 1S0/pn, 3S1/pn
    Or alternatively, integrate 1/N \int_kF^\infty d3q / (2\pi)^3 \int d3Q / (2\pi)^3 n(q, Q)
    where N is the total normalization of the pair momentum distribution (they use N = A/2)

--- Momentum distributions ---
* Try profiler on snmd.py to figure out where its slowest
* q = 0 case in pmd.py

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos

--- SRG ---
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * SRG inherit Potentials class? Generators inherit SRG class?
   See FRIBTA scattering notebooks for examples.

--- Misc. ---
 * Phase shift corrector function
 * Implementing Loguru, snoop, and heart rate
