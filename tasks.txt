--- SRC ---

 * Revamp momentum distribution codes
   - Update pmd.py (Figure out why things differ by a factor of (2\pi)^3)
     * Compare asymptotic relation in test_scipt.py with AV18 C12 data too
   - Update dmd.py
     * Generate data for single-nucleon
   - Update src_physics_write_data.ipynb and generate all data again
   - Update src_physics_fig.ipynb and generate all figures again (Dropbox first, then update GitHub version)
   - Delete data/figures that aren't correct (kvnn = 222, 224)
   - Update README.md

 * Update curly brackets in appendix of paper

 Checks
 * Compare analytic \theta evaluation to numerical (analytic gives (4\pi)^2 kF^6 / 9) [test_script.py]
 * Check asymptotic relation between SNMD and PMD again [src_physics_figs.ipynb]
 * Deuteron: Compare LDA pair vs LDA single-nucleon [dmd.py (under if __name__==...)]

 * Read QMC papers in Slack: Marino_2021 and Stoitsov_2010

 * Updates to momentum distributions file
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Attach codes and figures

 * Finalize extra functions in SRC notebooks
   - GCF contacts: ratios and absolute
   - Factorization in other partial waves (e.g., U_1P1(k_i, q) / U_1P1(k_0, q)

 * Add 'Integrate' option to pmd.py

 * Check if interpolations are working correctly (swap UnivariateSpline and RectBivariateSpline)
   - Compare \delta U matrix elements to interpolated functions evaluated at same points

 * Update \theta functions in snmd.py to match paper (even though they're the same)

 * Would it be a better approximation to use block-diagonal decoupling with LDA?

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?

 * Many-body textbook
 * Renormalization textbook
 * EFT paper (Epelbaum primer)
 * Scattering theory textbook

--- Misc. ---
 * Phase shift corrector function
 * Implementing Loguru, snoop, and heart rate?
