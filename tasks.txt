--- SRC ---

* Gameplan
  - Create 3-body SRC notebook (start with outline)
  - Create deuteron electrodisintegration notebook? (Think about approximations)

* 3-body contributions in low RG SRC physics
   - Read important section of Bogner_2009bt.
   - Fill in code for 3-body notebook. Update figures.
   - Think again why \lambda dependence is important. Read Neff again. (Summarize in your own words.)
   - Start Overleaf document with summary and results. Add diagrammatic analysis section.
   - Check each diagram and think of others
   - How can you approximate 3-body terms? Read Jurgenson_2009qs.
   - Issues with Q > 0? Smear \theta functions? Fermi functions?

 * Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)

 * Approximations for electrodisintegration

 * Read QE electron scattering references

--- Momentum distributions ---
* Try profiler on snmd.py to figure out where its slowest
* q = 0 case in pmd.py
* Would it be a better approximation to use block-diagonal decoupling with HF+LDA?

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?
