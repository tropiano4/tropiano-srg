--- SRC ---

* Darmstadt seminar (have answers prepared for these and/or edits done before)
  - Edits:
    * Finish slides 52-57 working on notes at the bottom (don't forget caption!)
        -Start with exclusive knockout e,e'p reactions
        -Go over general picture/description (using \sigma_reduced figure)
	-Mention lower momentum than SRC physics
	-Need a reduction of cross sections to agree with experiment
        -Further, this has a systematic dependence on \Delta S (explain Gade plots)
        -Can understand using RG, mismatch of scales
        -Focusing on (e,e'p) spectroscopic factors first using SRG
    * Put in Dropbox
    * Add experimental extras for how the experiments detect SRC pairs (extras)
    * Add universality slide of wave functions (extras)
    * Factorization slide with sketch of derivation (extras)
    * Put in Dropbox

  - Questions to consider:
    * Better understand how SRC pairs are detected.
    * Why is deuteron \ataq and pair the same?
    * Better understanding of how to explain factorization.
    * Come up with a clear reason for why \sigma_SRC -> 0 when mismatched structure/reactions where
      it's \sigma_(e,e'p) > \sigma_exp when mismatched.

* Knock-out reactions
  - Calculate spectroscopic factor for particular state
    * Derivations
      - Flesh out iPad derivations (make presentable)
    * Jupyter notebook
      - Compare to single-nucleon momentum distributions using SM states
  - Add full derivation to Overleaf
  - Read Barbieri paper
  - Analytically calculate 3-body terms
  - How to do correlated ground state (references?)
  - Read references Yang, More
    * Add summary/takeaways to Overleaf notes (questions!)
  - Continue notes
    * Fill in introductory stuff for spectroscopic factors
  - Approximations for electrodisintegration?
  - Inclusion of FSIs

* Extensions to SRC physics at low RG resolution
  - 3-D version of \lambda dependence plot
  - 2nd term in DME
    * Check Heaviside function from the d^3s integral in the single-nucleon case
    * Check the second term by including it in a simple calculation involving only the
      normalization of the density matrix.
  - Check each diagram and think of others. Add takeaway points to Overleaf.
  - How can you approximate 3-body terms? Read Bogner_2007qb.

* Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)
  - Read Weiss_2016obx for reference
  - Inconsistency on how to extract? You can use single-nucleon probability distribution if you
    isolate the following pieces: 1S0/nn, 1S0/pp, 1S0/pn, 3S1/pn
    Or alternatively, integrate 1/N \int_kF^\infty d3q / (2\pi)^3 \int d3Q / (2\pi)^3 n(q, Q)
    where N is the total normalization of the pair momentum distribution (they use N = A/2)

--- Momentum distributions ---
* Try profiler on snmd.py to figure out where its slowest
* q = 0 case in pmd.py

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos

--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * SRG inherit Potentials class? Generators inherit SRG class?
   See FRIBTA scattering notebooks for examples.
