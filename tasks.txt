--- SRC ---

* Extensions to SRC physics at low RG resolution
   - Check each diagram and think of others. Add to Overleaf.
   - Smear \theta functions? Fermi functions? pmd_new.py (special case where Q=0?)
     From wiki: H(x) = lim_{k->\infty} 1/(1+exp^(-2kx))
     Take 2k = 2\beta and replace \theta(kF(R)-q) with 1 / ( 1+exp^( -2*\beta*(kF(R)-q) ) )
     Take \beta at 10000 to check it's the same. Try other values.
     Test \lambda dependence and compare to AV18 QMC C12 results.
   - 2nd term in DME.
   - Scheme dependence? Use block-diagonal decoupling.
   - Think again why \lambda dependence is important. Read Neff again. (Summarize in your own words.)
   - How can you approximate 3-body terms? Read Jurgenson_2009qs and Bogner_2007qb.
   - Update notes after reading papers.

 * Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)
   - Inconsistency on how to extract? You can use single-nucleon probability distribution if you
     isolate the following pieces: 1S0/nn, 1S0/pp, 1S0/pn, 3S1/pn
     Or alternatively, integrate 1/N \int_kF^\infty d3q / (2\pi)^3 \int d3Q / (2\pi)^3 n(q, Q)
     where N is the total normalization of the pair momentum distribution (they use N = A/2)

 * Approximations for electrodisintegration

 * Read QE electron scattering references

--- Momentum distributions ---
* Try profiler on snmd.py to figure out where its slowest
* q = 0 case in pmd.py
* Would it be a better approximation to use block-diagonal decoupling with HF+LDA?

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?
