--- SRC ---

* Knock-out reactions and spectroscopic factors
  - Read optical potential notes and add comments
  - Apply PEP 8 style guide to spectroscopic_factors.ipynb
  - Add other nuclear s.p. wave functions to densities
  - Update Overleaf
    * Derivation of Dec 15th equation in notebook
    * Results
    * Add seminar questions to Overleaf with first pass of answers
  - Literature review
    * Rios (2009)
    * Catford (2019)
    * Jensen (2011)
    * Rios (2010)

  - Add summaries to Overleaf
  - Compute with spectroscopic_factors.ipynb
    * Derive where state \alpha tells us spin projection of particle and a_\pvec is
      a_{\pvec, \sigma, \tau} (for initial IPSM first)
  - How to do correlated ground state (references?)

* Extensions to SRC physics at low RG resolution
  - 3-D version of \lambda dependence plot
  - HF ground state using single-particle wave functions
  - 2nd term in DME
    * Check Heaviside function from the d^3s integral in the single-nucleon case
    * Check the second term by including it in a simple calculation involving only the
      normalization of the density matrix.
  - Check each diagram and think of others. Add takeaway points to Overleaf.
  - How can you approximate 3-body terms? Read Bogner_2007qb.

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas

--- SRG ---
 * Test C++ with SRG flow equation.
