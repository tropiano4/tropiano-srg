--- Numerical/analytical work ---

* Change ylim to (0, 15) for pn/d figures
* Try \lambda_matching analysis but for AV18 to RKE 550 MeV, RKE 450 MeV, Gezerlis 1 fm
* Update DF/SB on 3S1-3D1 only analysis
* Add to Overleaf:
    Cross section ratio should be independent of scale (V_NN(\Lambda) and SRG \lambda)
    Why are our L values inconsistent with scale independence?
* Use Weinberg eigenvalues to find matching \lambda between RKE potentials

  ...

* Revisit Dickhoff chapter 7 ideas
  (evolving s.p. propagator, sum rules, connecting to occupation number operator)
  Write out relation between hole propagator, full s.p. propagator, spectral function,
  cross section, spectroscopic factor, self-energy, and HF approximation
* Contact Ragnar about collaborating
* Try implementing Moshinsky brackets to reduce \phi's
  - Questions (record on iPad)?

  - Shell model textbooks
* Multiply \phi_\alpha(p) by SF to test p-dependence
* Look at disentangling Ylm's using L to l1, l2 coupling from Glockle
* Add other nuclear s.p. wave functions to densities

  ...

* HF ground state with s.p. wave functions (SNMD calculation)
* How to do correlated ground state (references?)
* 3-D \lambda dependence plot (with q)
* How can 3-body terms be approximated (Bogner_2007qb)
* Approximations for electrodisintegration? Inclusion of FSIs?
* Fix Potentials Fortran and Perl codes (not finding BLAS)
  Error message is after running make -f make_generate_vsrg_vlowk
  "gfortran -o generate_vsrg_vlowk.x  ./src/nrtype.o ... ./src/generate_vsrg_vlowk.o -L/usr/local/opt/lapack/lib -llapack -lblas
ld: library not found for -lSystem"
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos
* Tidy-up potentials/vsrg_macos
* Test C++ with SRG flow equation
* Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
* SRG inherit Potentials class? Generators inherit SRG class? (See FRIBTA scattering notebooks for examples)
* Implementing Loguru, snoop, and heart rate

Note: This also includes presentation-related work


--- Overleaf ---

* Understand E1 and M1 transitions (reference 8 in Weiss_2014gua)
* Iterate on story line for QD introduction
  - Add other summaries:
      Paragraph or several sentences on experiments?
      Chadwick paper
* Add results with takeaways to QD paper
* Iterate on formalism section (full but bulleted)

  ...

* Derivation of spectroscopic factor (sf_notes.tex)
* Add results corresponding to derivation
* Read optical potential notes: Add comments and edit
  (Left off at Optical Potential and SRG Fundamentals)
