--- Numerical/analytical work ---

* Continue working on L vs A plot
  * Run L plot results and ratios for new potentials (update revision history) Nij2 and CD-Bonn
  * Include other nuclei on L plot (update revision history)
* Change Gezerlis N2LO to GT+ N2LO in labeling
* Fine tune plot_momentum_dist

  ...

* Revisit Dickhoff chapter 7 ideas
  (evolving s.p. propagator, sum rules, connecting to occupation number operator)
  Write out relation between hole propagator, full s.p. propagator, spectral function,
  cross section, spectroscopic factor, self-energy, and HF approximation
* Contact Ragnar about collaborating
* Try implementing Moshinsky brackets to reduce \phi's
  - Questions (record on iPad)?
    https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.535.3897&rep=rep1&type=pdf
  - Shell model textbooks
* Multiply \phi_\alpha(p) by SF to test p-dependence
* Look at disentangling Ylm's using L to l1, l2 coupling from Glockle
* Add other nuclear s.p. wave functions to densities

  ...

* HF ground state with s.p. wave functions (SNMD calculation)
* How to do correlated ground state (references?)
* 3-D \lambda dependence plot (with q)
* How can 3-body terms be approximated (Bogner_2007qb)
* Approximations for electrodisintegration? Inclusion of FSIs?
* Fix Potentials Fortran and Perl codes (not finding BLAS)
  Error message is after running make -f make_generate_vsrg_vlowk
  "gfortran -o generate_vsrg_vlowk.x  ./src/nrtype.o ... ./src/generate_vsrg_vlowk.o -L/usr/local/opt/lapack/lib -llapack -lblas
ld: library not found for -lSystem"
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos
* Tidy-up potentials/vsrg_macos
* Test C++ with SRG flow equation
* Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
* SRG inherit Potentials class? Generators inherit SRG class? (See FRIBTA scattering notebooks for examples)
* Implementing Loguru, snoop, and heart rate

Note: This also includes presentation-related work
