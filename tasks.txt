--- SRC ---

 * \lambda dependence plot
   - Add \lambda = 10, 9.5, 9.0, update plots
   - Do He4
   
 * Fix high-Q, low-q bug in pmd.py (negative momentum distributions)

 * Derive pair momentum distribution with 3-body terms
   - Read Bogner_2006pc and Jurgenson_2009qs

 * Approximations for electrodisintegration

 * Smear \theta functions? Fermi functions?

 * Outline for new paper

 * Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)

 * Read QE electron scattering references

 * Updates to momentum distributions file
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Attach codes and figures

--- Momentum distributions ---
* Figure bug in last Q point in pmd.py files
* Try profiler on snmd.py to figure out where its slowest
* q = 0 case in pmd.py
* Would it be a better approximation to use block-diagonal decoupling with HF+LDA?

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?

--- Read ---
 * QFT textbook
 * Many-body textbook
 * Renormalization textbook
 * EFT paper (Epelbaum primer)
 * Scattering theory textbook

--- Misc. ---
 * Phase shift corrector function
 * Implementing Loguru, snoop, and heart rate
