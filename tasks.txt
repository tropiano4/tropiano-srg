--- SRC ---

* Knock-out reactions
  - Approximations for electrodisintegration (see SM papers / questions)
  - Read QE electron scattering references (questions)

* Extensions to SRC physics at low RG resolution
  - 3-D version of \lambda dependence plot
  - Add contours of \delta U^2 for block-diagonal
  - Read Neff again. (Summarize in your own words.)
  - Update notes after reading papers. Add Negele summary or something about DME?
  - Add term(\beta) to FF to fix normalization (I term only!)
  - 2nd term in DME
    * Check Heaviside function from the d^3s integral in the single-nucleon case
    * Check the second term by including it in a simple calculation involving only the
      normalization of the density matrix.
  - Check each diagram and think of others. Add takeaway points to Overleaf.
  - How can you approximate 3-body terms? Read Bogner_2007qb.

* Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)
  - Read Weiss_2016obx for reference
  - Inconsistency on how to extract? You can use single-nucleon probability distribution if you
    isolate the following pieces: 1S0/nn, 1S0/pp, 1S0/pn, 3S1/pn
    Or alternatively, integrate 1/N \int_kF^\infty d3q / (2\pi)^3 \int d3Q / (2\pi)^3 n(q, Q)
    where N is the total normalization of the pair momentum distribution (they use N = A/2)

  Summary
  - NCSM used to build wave function for He4 with SRG transformed interactions, and the
    wave functions are used to compute bare and SRG transformed interactions
  - 2-body approximation for evolved operator so \lambda dependence tells us about missing many-
    body correlations
  - Many-body correlations are small for Q = 0 but not negligible for higher Q
  - Pair density (coordinate space) with transformed density operator only disagrees near peaks
    at r ~ 1-1.3 fm
  - Pair relative momentum distribution deviates at k ~ fm^-1 from induced terms from the
    two-bodytensor force. Similar to our results but opposite \lambda dependence. 
* Jurgenson_2009qs
  Summary
  - Harmonic oscillator basis for A = 4 (He4)
  - SRG does not reshuffle hierarchy of many-body terms in \chi^EFT
  - \lambda = 2 fm^-1 is a good compromise between improved convergence from decoupling and
    the growth of induced many-body interactions
  - 2-body evolved operator gets no contribution from 3-body
    3-body evolved operator gets contributions from 2-body but not 4-body
  - Jacobi coordinate harmonic oscillator basis of NCSM
  - NN-only fails and has \lambda dependence, NN+NNN induced is flat but off,
    NN+NNN initial looks good
  - Basis size convergence improved with SRG
  - Net induced four-body contribution is smaller than truncation errors of the chiral interaction
* Negele_1972zp

  - Expansion of nuclear wave function density matrix in relative and CM coordinates
  - First term gives local density dependence
