--- SRC ---

 * Update Figs. 8 and 10, table
   - Write files over night
   - COMPARE FILES IN REPOSITORY (NEW) TO FILES IN DROPBOX (OLD)
   - Copy/paste new files

 * Revamp momentum distribution codes
   - First make lda.py -> densities.py with just load_density function and tests below
   - Correct first term in pair \int d3r d3r'
   - Update single-nucleon momentum distribution figures
   - Update pair momentum distribution figures

 CHECKS
 * Compare analytic \theta evaluation to numerical
 * Check asymptotic relation between SNMD and PMD again
 * Deuteron: Compare LDA pair vs LDA single-nucleon

 * Read QMC papers in Slack: Marino_2021 and Stoitsov_2010

 * Updates to momentum distributions file
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Attach codes and figures

 * Finalize extra functions in SRC notebooks
   - A/C12 ratio
   - GCF contacts: ratios and absolute
   - Factorization in other partial waves (e.g., U_1P1(k_i, q) / U_1P1(k_0, q)
   - Numerically check asymptotic relation of SNMD and PMD

 * Add 'Integrate' option to pmd.py

 * Monte Carlo integrals for angle-averaging

 * Would it be a better approximation to use block-diagonal decoupling with LDA?

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?
