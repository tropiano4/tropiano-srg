--- SRC ---

* Knock-out reactions
  - Literature review
  - Add summaries to Overleaf
  - Check if disconnected diagrams cancel in SF derivation
  - Calculate spectroscopic factor for particular state
    * Flesh out iPad derivations (make presentable)
    * WT to a^t ( I + a^t a^t a a + a^t a^t a^t a a a) a (I + a^t a^t a a + a^t a^t a^t a a a)
      and truncate 4-body and higher
    * Fully uncorrelated states \Psi_\lambda -> means you can take a^t out of A-1 WF
    * In HF calculation, one configuration: \Psi is filled by s.p. states for closed shell
    * In LDA calculation, \Psi is Fermi gas averaging over kF(R)
  - Compute with spectroscopic_factors.ipynb
  - Add full derivation to Overleaf
  - Read Barbieri paper
  - How to do correlated ground state (references?)
  - Read references Yang, More
    * Add summary/takeaways to Overleaf notes (questions!)
  - Approximations for electrodisintegration?
  - Inclusion of FSIs

* Extensions to SRC physics at low RG resolution
  - 3-D version of \lambda dependence plot
  - 2nd term in DME
    * Check Heaviside function from the d^3s integral in the single-nucleon case
    * Check the second term by including it in a simple calculation involving only the
      normalization of the density matrix.
  - Check each diagram and think of others. Add takeaway points to Overleaf.
  - How can you approximate 3-body terms? Read Bogner_2007qb.

* Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)
  - Read Weiss_2016obx for reference
  - Inconsistency on how to extract? You can use single-nucleon probability distribution if you
    isolate the following pieces: 1S0/nn, 1S0/pp, 1S0/pn, 3S1/pn
    Or alternatively, integrate 1/N \int_kF^\infty d3q / (2\pi)^3 \int d3Q / (2\pi)^3 n(q, Q)
    where N is the total normalization of the pair momentum distribution (they use N = A/2)

--- Momentum distributions ---
* Try profiler on snmd.py to figure out where its slowest
* q = 0 case in pmd.py

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos

--- SRG ---
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * SRG inherit Potentials class? Generators inherit SRG class?
   See FRIBTA scattering notebooks for examples.

--- Misc. ---
 * Phase shift corrector function
 * Implementing Loguru, snoop, and heart rate
