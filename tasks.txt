--- Numerical/analytical work ---

* Add bulleted takeaways to Overleaf
* Look at \psi_d(r) in coordinate space connecting hard/soft potentials to decide on \lambda'
* Iterate on quasideuteron.ipynb
  - To-do
  - Move things to extras
* Use Weinberg eigenvalues to find matching \lambda between RKE potentials?

  ...

* Revisit Dickhoff chapter 7 ideas
  (evolving s.p. propagator, sum rules, connecting to occupation number operator)
  Write out relation between hole propagator, full s.p. propagator, spectral function,
  cross section, spectroscopic factor, self-energy, and HF approximation
* Contact Ragnar about collaborating
* Try implementing Moshinsky brackets to reduce \phi's
* Multiply \phi_\alpha(p) by SF to test p-dependence
* Look at disentangling Ylm's using L to l1, l2 coupling from Glockle
* Add other nuclear s.p. wave functions to densities

  ...

* HF ground state with s.p. wave functions (SNMD calculation)
* How to do correlated ground state (references?)
* 3-D \lambda dependence plot (with q)
* How can 3-body terms be approximated (Bogner_2007qb)
* Approximations for electrodisintegration? Inclusion of FSIs?
* Fix Potentials Fortran and Perl codes (not finding BLAS)
  Error message is after running make -f make_generate_vsrg_vlowk
  "gfortran -o generate_vsrg_vlowk.x  ./src/nrtype.o ... ./src/generate_vsrg_vlowk.o -L/usr/local/opt/lapack/lib -llapack -lblas
ld: library not found for -lSystem"
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos
* Tidy-up potentials/vsrg_macos
* Test C++ with SRG flow equation
* Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
* SRG inherit Potentials class? Generators inherit SRG class? (See FRIBTA scattering notebooks for examples)
* Implementing Loguru, snoop, and heart rate

Note: This also includes presentation-related work


--- Overleaf ---

* Check range of energies (Levinger and other references) - answer comment
* Why is the cross section ratio effectively the ratio of squared wave functions? (Levinger)
* How do Weiss et al. say the A/d cross section is related to contacts?
* Understand E1 and M1 transitions (reference 8 in Weiss_2014gua)
* Address other comments by DF...
* Iterate on entire paper
  - Add questions to address here
  - Remove changes and resolve comments

  ...

* Derivation of spectroscopic factor (sf_notes.tex)
* Add results corresponding to derivation

* Write full SRG chapter

  ...

* Edit introduction outline and text
  - Any references I should read (after reading first two sections)?
  - Figure out where figures should go:
    1. Nuclear chart
    2. Nuclear degrees of freedom and scales
    3. V_NN(r) in 1S0 channel
    4. Chiral EFT diagrams
    5. V_{low-k} and SRG cartoons
