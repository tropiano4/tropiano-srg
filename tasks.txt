  Write out relation between hole propagator, full s.p. propagator, spectral function,
  cross section, and spectroscopic factor
* Contact Ragnar about collaborating

* Approximations for electrodisintegration? Inclusion of FSIs?
* Fix Potentials Fortran and Perl codes (not finding BLAS)
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos
* Test C++ with SRG flow equation
* Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
