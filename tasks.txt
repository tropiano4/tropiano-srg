--- SRC ---

 * \lambda dependence: add \lambda values (10, 8, etc.) to n_{\lambda}^A(q) vs q figures

 * Update dmd.py, snmd.py, and all related files

 * Why does He4 disagree?

 * Make src_physics_fig_v1.ipynb, src_physics_write_data_v1.ipynb and src_physics_fig.ipynb, src_physics_write_data.ipynb

 * Add q=0 case to pmd.py

 * Read Neff/Feldmeyer paper

 * Outline for new paper

 * Do He8 distributions

 * Derive pair momentum distribution with 3-body terms

 * Contact ratios

 * Read QE electron scattering references

 * Would it be a better approximation to use block-diagonal decoupling with LDA?

 * Updates to momentum distributions file
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Attach codes and figures

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?
