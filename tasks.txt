--- SRC ---

 * Changes to paper
   - Add axes labels to Fig. 2
   - Add p+n description for a2, Table I caption to distinguish proton dist.
   - Add sources of disagreement near kF in Fig. 8: sharp Fermi surface cutoff, DME corrections, long-ranged correlations
   - Update Fig. 8 without He3
   - Go through a2 comment in more detail (iPad)
   - Refer to supplementary material: factorization figures
   - Do factorization figure at fixed k, vary q, no ratio?

 * Read Witek paper again?

 * Derive pair momentum distribution with 3-body terms (iPad)
   -Diagrams
   -3-body SRC physics at low resolution notes

 * Contact ratios (once you have He4 working)

 * Approximations for electrodisintegration

 * Issues with Q > 0? Smear \theta functions? Fermi functions?

 * Outline for new paper

 * Read QE electron scattering references

 * Updates to momentum distributions file
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Attach codes and figures

--- Momentum distributions ---
* Figure bug in last Q point in pmd.py files
* Try profiler on snmd.py to figure out where its slowest
* q = 0 case in pmd.py
* Would it be a better approximation to use block-diagonal decoupling with HF+LDA?

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?

--- Read ---

 * Renormalization textbook
 * EFT paper (Epelbaum primer)
 * Scattering theory textbook

--- Misc. ---
