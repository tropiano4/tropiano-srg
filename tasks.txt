 * Cancellation of \delta U terms
   - Go to partial waves using Dickhoff expression
 
 * Check cancellation for particular kF(r)
 
 * Add derivations to Overleaf

 * Revamp pmd.py and lda.py (What's the best way to do this? Probably one script added to pmd.py?)
   - Correct first term in pair \int d3r d3r'

 * Updates to momentum distributions file
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Attach codes and figures

 * Update snmd.py to account for q \dot K angle
   - Update to have one double \theta function evaluation for pn

 * Check that angle-averaging gives the same result as analytic for N=Z

 * Update SRC notes with new figures
   - Write files again

 * Finalize extra functions in SRC notebooks
   - A/C12 ratio
   - GCF contacts: ratios and absolute
   - Factorization in other partial waves (e.g., U_1P1(k_i, q) / U_1P1(k_0, q)
   - Numerically check asymptotic relation of SNMD and PMD

 * Add 'Integrate' option to pmd.py

 * Would it be a better approximation to use block-diagonal decoupling with LDA?

--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?
