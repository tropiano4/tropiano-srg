--- SRC ---

 * Go through comments in Overleaf and add updated figures
   - Thorough edit of "Short-range correlation physics at low RG resolution"
   - Update this file, add comments, changes, and respond to DF comments
   - Update SRC notes and respond to DF comments

 * Try to understand normalization (unitarity check)
   - Factor of 1/2?

 * Update Figures in Overleaf notes with new figures and bullets of how each calculation is being done
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Focus on practicality and how you can make this clear to others
     (the goal is to figure out where mistakes are being made!)
   - Attach codes and figures
   - Add normalizations

 * Finalize extra functions in SRC notebooks
   - A/C12 ratio
   - S-waves dominance: n^total_S-waves / n^total_SPD-waves
   - GCF contacts: ratios and absolute
   - Factorization in other partial waves (e.g., U_1P1(k_i, q) / U_1P1(k_0, q)
   - Numerically check asymptotic relation of SNMD and PMD

 * Correct iPad momentum distribution notes? (Might be switching to DME description)

 * Add 'Integrate' option to pmd.py


--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?
