--- SRC ---

 * Check normalization of SNMD
   - Update snmd.py and pmd.py revision histories
   - Normalization of other nuclei in test_script?
   - Update SNMD figures in src_physics_fig.ipynb
   - Try putting multiple \lambda values on same plot (under extras in src_physics_fig.ipynb)
   - Bug in 3P2 and 3D3 channels?
       Interpolation problem?
   - Bug at last q-point in snmd.py?

 * Update Figures in Overleaf notes with new figures and bullets of how each calculation is being done
   - Figure out consistent continuum and partial wave basis normalizations
     * Organize notes on completeness, orthogonality, anti-symmetrized partial wave states
   - Focus on practicality and how you can make this clear to others
     (the goal is to figure out where mistakes are being made!)
   - Attach codes and figures

 * Go through comments in Overleaf and add updated figures
   (left off at Calculations and cartoons at low-resolution)

 * Finalize extra functions in SRC notebooks
   - Deuteron bar chart (do test example in test_script.py)
   - A/C12 ratio
   - S-waves dominance: n^total_S-waves / n^total_SPD-waves
   - GCF contacts: ratios and absolute
   - Factorization in other partial waves (e.g., U_1P1(k_i, q) / U_1P1(k_0, q)
   - Numerically check asymptotic relation of SNMD and PMD

 * Correct iPad momentum distribution notes? (Might be switching to DME description)

 * Update a2 plot with pp, pn, np, nn contributions?
   - Do \int dq P^A_{pp only}(q) / deuteron total and likewise for other pieces
   - Check that contributions give total result

 * Read Nikheff paper

 * Read Bethe paper


--- Potentials ---
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas
* Implement Gezerlis local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos


--- SRG ---
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   - ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   - High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?

--- Misc. ---
 * Phase shift corrector function
