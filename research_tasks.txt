SRC
 * Update Figures in Overleaf notes with new figures and bullets of how each calculation is being done

   - Outline:
     1. Brief description of notes in abstract
     2. Definitions and partial wave relations
        a. Operators
        b. Completeness relations
     3. Single-nucleon momentum distributions
        a. Contractions with respect to true vacuum
        b. Contractions with respect to filled Fermi sea
        c. Transformation to partial waves
        d. Angle-averaging
        e. Final expression
           - Give example with S-waves only
        f. Python implementation
           - Figures compared to AV18 data
     4. Pair momentum distributions
        a. Contractions with respect to true vacuum
        b. Contractions with respect to filled Fermi sea
        c. Transformation to partial waves
        d. Final expression
           - Give example with S-waves only and Q=0
        e. Python implementation
           - Figures compared to AV18 data
 
 * Go through DF comments in Overleaf and add updated figures (left off at Calculations and cartoons at low-resolution)
 * Figure out bug in pmd.py (first q value)
 * Finalize extra functions, a_2 averaging, writing directly to Dropbox in SRC notebooks
 * A/C12 ratio update: nuclei labels, more tick marks
 * S-wave dominance
   - Plot n^total_S-waves / n^total_SPD-waves
 ...
 * Absolute GCF contact calculation
 * How should you effectively split up contributions to pp, np, etc. in snmd.py, pmd.py, dmd.py?
   - Change lda.py to account for functions that return floats or tuples
 * Update a2 plot with pp, pn, np, nn contributions
   - Do \int dq P^A_{pp only}(q) / deuteron total and likewise for other pieces
   - Check that contributions give total result
 * Factorized S-wave only to factorized S-wave only then same idea for all partial waves
 * Numerically check asymptotic relation
   - Add in \d^3Q integration option to pmd.py
 * Read Nikheff paper
 * Read Bethe paper


Computer issues
* Fix Potentials Fortran/Perl codes
  - Not finding lapack or blas


SRG
 * Load and save evolved potentials from data frame?
 * SRG solver options
   -ode or solve_ivp, evolve w.r.t. s or \lambda
 * Try solving for U(s) or \delta U(s) instead
 * Open questions
   -High lambda (10 fm^-1) potential evolution bug?

Misc.
 * Phase shift corrector function
 * Implement Gez. local potential codes to Potentials/vsrg_macos
